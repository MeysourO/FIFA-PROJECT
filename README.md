# FIFA-21-Project

This project aims to predict a player's "Overall Rating" by analyzing data from the fifa21_train.csv dataset. The dataset can be found in the GDrive and is an extract from https://sofifa.com/.

## Dataset

The fifa21_train.csv dataset contains various attributes of FIFA 21 players such as age, nationality, potential, and overall rating. These attributes can be used to build a machine learning model that can predict a player's overall rating.

## Approach

We will use various machine learning algorithms to predict the overall rating of the players. Initially, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights about the dataset and preprocess it accordingly. After that, we will train and test different machine learning models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance. The best-performing model will be used to predict the overall rating of the players.

## Tools

The project will be implemented using Python programming language and the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

To run the project, you can download the fifa21_train.csv dataset from the GDrive and run the fifa21_project.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any other similar environment. The notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and evaluation.
